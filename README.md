### Self Balancing Robot 

1. TB6612FNG Motor Driver
2. Encoder
3. MPU -6050 (Gyroscope and Accelerometer)
4. HC-06 (Bluetooth module)
5. Ultrasonic sensor



### Motor Control
- Set the motor to be running at some certain RPM when the SBR is balanced
- Measure the RPM via the encoder

### Orientation control
- With the help of the MPU-6050 to retrieve information from the gyroscope and accelerometer sensor
- Gyroscope sensor is a device that can measure and maintain the orientation and angular velocity of an object. These are more advanced than accelerometers. These can measure the tilt and lateral orientation of the object whereas accelerometer can only measure the linear motion.
